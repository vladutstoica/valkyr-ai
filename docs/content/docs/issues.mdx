Valkyr connects to Linear, Jira, and GitHub Issues. Pass issues from your tracker directly to agents. The issue title, description, and metadata become part of the agent's prompt.

    display: 'block',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
  }}
/>

## How It Works
