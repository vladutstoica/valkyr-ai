title: Valkyr Overview
description: An Open Source Agentic Development Environment (ADE)
---

Valkyr is an open source desktop app for running multiple coding agents in parallel. Each agent works in an isolated Git worktree, so they don't interfere with each other.

## Capabilities

- **[Parallel agents](/parallel-agents):** Run multiple agents simultaneously, each in its own worktree
- **[Provider support](/providers):** Use any of 18+ CLI-based agents: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and more
- **[Best-of-N](/best-of-n):** Run multiple agents on the same task and pick the best result
- **[Diff view](/diff-view):** Review changes across agents side-by-side
- **[Kanban view](/kanban-view):** Organize tasks visually across your workflow
- **[Issue integration](/issues):** Pull tasks from Linear, Jira, or GitHub Issues directly

## How It Works

Click "Add Task" to create one or more worktrees. Each worktree runs its own agent. You can then review the diff when done, iterate if needed, and open a PR inside of Valkyr.
