description: Extend your agents with reusable skill modules

Skills are reusable capability modules that extend your coding agents with specialized functionality. They follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard and work across all supported agents—Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini, Roo Code, and Mistral Vibe.

## Browsing Skills

Open the Skills view by clicking **Skills** (puzzle icon) in the left sidebar. You'll see a catalog of available skills sourced from:

- [OpenAI skill library](https://github.com/openai/skills/)
- [Anthropic skill library](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/)

Use the search box to filter by name or description. Click **Refresh** to fetch the latest skills from GitHub.

If you want to use skills from another library, feel free to let us know through the feedback modal in the app.

## Installing a Skill

1. Find a skill in the catalog
2. Click the skill card to view details, example prompts, and documentation
3. Click **Install**

Valkyr downloads the skill to `~/.agentskills/` and automatically syncs it to all installed agents on your machine. The skill is immediately available in your next agent session.

## Uninstalling a Skill

1. Click an installed skill card
2. Click **Uninstall** in the detail modal

This removes the skill from `~/.agentskills/` and removes the symlinks from all agent directories.

## Creating Custom Skills

1. Click **New Skill** in the Skills view
2. Enter a name (lowercase, hyphens, 2–64 characters) and description
3. Click **Create**

Valkyr generates a `SKILL.md` file in `~/.agentskills/<your-skill>/` and opens the directory so you can edit it. The file uses YAML frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
name: 'my-skill'
description: 'What this skill does'
---
# My Skill

Instructions and documentation for the agent...
```

Custom skills sync to all installed agents just like catalog skills.

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file. When installed, Valkyr creates symlinks in each agent's config directory:

| Agent        | Skill location                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Claude Code  | `~/.claude/commands/<skill>/`        |
| Codex        | `~/.codex/skills/<skill>/`           |
| OpenCode     | `~/.config/opencode/skills/<skill>/` |
| Cursor       | `~/.cursor/skills/<skill>/`          |
| Gemini       | `~/.gemini/skills/<skill>/`          |
| Roo Code     | `~/.roo/skills/<skill>/`             |
| Mistral Vibe | `~/.vibe/skills/<skill>/`            |

This means skills you install through Valkyr also work when you run these agents outside of Valkyr.

## Example Skills

The catalog includes skills for many common workflows:

- **Deployment**: Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify deploy
- **Design**: Figma integration, design implementation
- **GitHub**: Address PR comments, fix CI failures
- **Documentation**: Word docs, Jupyter notebooks
- **Content**: Image generation
- **Integrations**: Linear, Notion, Stripe, Twilio

Each skill includes an example prompt showing how to invoke it.

## Tips

- Skills persist across Valkyr sessions—install once, use everywhere.
- Click the terminal icon on an installed skill to open its directory and inspect or edit the `SKILL.md` directly.
- Custom skills appear in the "Installed" section alongside catalog skills.
- If an agent can't find a skill, make sure the agent is detected by Valkyr (check the Skills view footer for detected agents).
