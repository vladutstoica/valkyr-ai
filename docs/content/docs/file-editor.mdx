The file editor lets you browse and edit code in a task's worktree without switching to an external editor. Use it to explore the codebase, make edits yourself, or review what an agent has done.

## Opening the Editor

Click the code icon in the titlebar when viewing a task. The editor opens in a side panel with a file tree on the left and the code editor on the right.

## Navigating Files

The left panel shows your project's file tree. Click a file to open it. Files open in tabs at the top of the editor, so you can switch between multiple files.

Common system directories like `node_modules`, `.git`, and build output are hidden by default. Click the eye icon to show or hide them.

## Editing

The editor is a full-featured code editor with syntax highlighting, find/replace, and the usual keyboard shortcuts. Changes auto-save after 2 seconds of inactivity, or press `⌘S` to save immediately.

Git diff markers appear in the gutter:

- Green dots for added lines
- Orange dots for modified lines
- Red markers for deleted lines

These update automatically as you edit, so you can see what's changed compared to the last commit.

## Saving

Files with unsaved changes show a dot in their tab. Use `⌘⇧S` to save all open files at once, or click "Save All" in the header.

After saving, the [diff view](/diff-view) updates to reflect your changes.

## Images

The editor also handles images. Click an image file to preview it instead of showing raw bytes.

## Resizing

Drag the divider between the file tree and editor to adjust panel widths. The layout remembers your preference.
