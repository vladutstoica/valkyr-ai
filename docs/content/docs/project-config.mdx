description: Customize Valkyr behavior per project
---

Valkyr can be configured on a per-project basis using a `.valkyr.json` file in your project root. This lets you tailor how worktrees are set up and which files get copied to them.

## Copying files to worktrees

When you create a new task, Valkyr sets up a Git worktree so the agent can work in isolation. By default, worktrees start fresh from your repository, which means gitignored files like `.env` won't be there.

To solve this, Valkyr automatically copies certain gitignored files from your main project into each new worktree. This happens once when the worktree is created, and only for files that don't already exist in the destination.

The default patterns cover common environment files:

```
.env
.env.keys
.env.local
.env.*.local
.envrc
docker-compose.override.yml
```

These defaults work well for most projects, but you can customize them if needed.

## Custom preserve patterns

To specify your own list of files to copy, create a `.valkyr.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "preservePatterns": [".env", ".env.local", "config/local.yml", "secrets/*.json"]
}
```

When you define `preservePatterns`, it replaces the defaults entirely. Include any default patterns you still want alongside your custom ones.

Patterns support basic glob syntax, so `secrets/*.json` will match all JSON files in the secrets directory. Files inside `node_modules`, `.git`, `vendor`, and other common build directories are automatically excluded regardless of your patterns.

## How it works

Valkyr looks for gitignored files in your main project that match your preserve patterns. For each match, it copies the file to the same relative path in the new worktree. If a file already exists in the worktree, it's left untouched, so your worktree-specific changes won't be overwritten.

This means you can safely modify environment files in a worktree without worrying about them being reset when you create new tasks.

## Setup scripts

You can run a command automatically when a new task is created. This is useful for installing dependencies, starting dev servers, or any other initialization your project needs.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "pnpm install && pnpm run dev"
  }
}
```

The setup script runs in the task's terminal as soon as the worktree is ready. It runs in parallel with the agent starting, so the agent can begin working while your dev server spins up.

## Task env vars

When a task terminal starts, Valkyr injects convenience environment variables you can use inside setup scripts and other terminal commands.

| Variable                | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `VALKYR_TASK_ID`        | Stable unique task id            |
| `VALKYR_TASK_NAME`      | Shell-safe task name slug        |
| `VALKYR_TASK_PATH`      | Absolute task (worktree) path    |
| `VALKYR_ROOT_PATH`      | Absolute project root path       |
| `VALKYR_DEFAULT_BRANCH` | Default branch name (e.g., main) |
| `VALKYR_PORT`           | Base port for a 10-port range    |

### Example: Port-aware setup script

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "export PORT=$VALKYR_PORT && export DB_PORT=$((VALKYR_PORT + 1)) && export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=$VALKYR_TASK_NAME && docker-compose up -d && pnpm run dev"
  }
}
```

### Example: docker-compose override with task ports

```yaml
services:
  db:
    ports:
      - '${VALKYR_PORT:-5432}:5432'
  app:
    environment:
      - DATABASE_PORT=${VALKYR_PORT:-5432}
```

### Example: Port offsets (app + db + redis)

```
APP_PORT=$VALKYR_PORT
DB_PORT=$((VALKYR_PORT + 1))
REDIS_PORT=$((VALKYR_PORT + 2))
```

### Examples

Install dependencies:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "pnpm install"
  }
}
```

Install and start dev server:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "pnpm install && pnpm run dev"
  }
}
```

Python project with virtual environment:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt"
  }
}
```

## Editing the config

You can edit your project's `.valkyr.json` directly from the app. On the project page, click "Edit config" to open the configuration file in the built-in editor.
