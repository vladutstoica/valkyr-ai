description: Monitor GitHub Actions check runs directly in Valkyr
---

Valkyr surfaces your GitHub Actions CI/CD status inside the app so you can monitor check runs without switching to a browser.

    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: '700px',
    margin: '20px auto',
    display: 'block',
    borderRadius: '8px',

  }}

## Viewing Checks

Once a task has a Pull Request, a **Checks** tab appears in the file changes panel. Click it to see all check runs for that PR's branch.

Each check shows:

- **Status**: Green checkmark (pass), red X (fail), amber spinner (pending), or grey dash (skipped/cancelled)
- **Name and workflow**: Which check ran and from which workflow
- **Duration**: How long the check took
- **External link**: Click to open the full check run on GitHub

A summary at the top shows the total count of passed, failed, and pending checks.

## Auto-Refresh

Valkyr automatically polls for check updates:

- **Every 10 seconds** while checks are still running
- **Every 60 seconds** once all checks complete
- **On window focus** — checks refresh when you switch back to Valkyr

Polling pauses when the app is in the background to save resources.

## Requirements

- The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- The task's branch must have an open Pull Request on GitHub
- Your repository must have GitHub Actions workflows configured

If the Checks tab is disabled, it means no PR exists for the current task yet. Push a branch and open a PR to start seeing checks.

## Tips

- The Checks tab automatically activates when a PR exists but there are no local uncommitted changes.
- Failed checks show a red dot on the tab badge so you can spot failures at a glance.
- A spinning indicator on the tab badge means checks are still in progress.
- Click the external link icon on any check to jump straight to the run details on GitHub.
