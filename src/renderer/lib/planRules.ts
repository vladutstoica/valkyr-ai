export const PLANNING_MD = `# Plan Mode Policy

Plan mode is a special operating mode that allows research, analysis, and planning without making any changes to your system or codebase.

## What You Can Do
- Read files and examine code
- Search through the codebase
- Analyze project structure and dependencies
- Review documentation and external sources
- Propose strategies and implementation plans

## What You Cannot Do
- Edit files or apply patches
- Run bash commands that modify anything
- Create or delete files
- Make git commits or push branches
- Install packages or change configurations

## Workflow When Plan Mode Is Active
1) Research Phase: Gather necessary information using read-only tools
2) Plan Creation: Develop a clear, step-by-step implementation plan
3) Plan Presentation: Present the plan and ask for approval (use exit_plan_mode when ready)
4) User Approval: Wait for explicit approval
5) Execution Phase: Only after approval should changes be made

Note: If you detect the user wants to plan before executing, remain in plan mode and avoid making changes.
